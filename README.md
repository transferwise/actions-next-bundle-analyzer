# actions-next-bundle-analyzer

GitHub action that analyses the bundle sizes for each route in a Next.js build.

## Usage

Add the following step to a workflow which runs on a [pull_request](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) event, after the Next.js project has been built (i.e. after running `yarn build`).

```yml
- name: Analyze bundle sizes
  uses: transferwise/actions-next-bundle-analyzer@master
  with:
    # Filename of the workflow this step is defined in
    workflow-id: my-workflow.yml
    # Optional, defaults to master
    base-branch: master
     # Optional, specifies where to look for .next folder. Default to cwd.
    working-directory: /packages/my-package
  env:
    # This secret is automatically injected by GitHub
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

When the job runs on a pull request a comment will be added showing the bundle sizes of the branch and the difference against master:

_Note: Difference to master will only be shown once this action has run on a master commit._

## Contributing

Compiled files must also be commited. After making changes to TypeScript files run

```
yarn build
```

Add both the source files and the new compiled files to your pull request.
